    Run a shell command on the host system.

    Args:
        command (Command):
            the command to run.
        std_input (Optional[str], optional):
            input to feed to the command.
            Defaults to None.
        current_dir (Optional[PathType], optional):
            directory where to run the command. If None, the current directory is used.
            Defaults to None.
        environment (Environment, optional):
            environment variables to pass to the command.
            Defaults to None.
        shell (bool, optional):
            whether to run the command in a shell environment (like "bash") or as a real command
            given to "exec".
            Defaults to False.
        print_command (bool, optional):
            whether to print the command.
            Defaults to True.
        print_output (bool, optional):
            whether to print the output.
            Defaults to True.
        print_env (bool, optional):
            whether to print the environment variables when they are defined.
            Defaults to True.
        print_curdir (bool, optional):
            whether to print the current directory if provided.
            Defaults to True.
        print_shell_cmd (bool, optional):
            whether to print the complete shell command, ready to be copy-pasted in a terminal.
            Defaults to False.
        print_file_shell_cmd (bool, optional):
            whether to print the shell command in a log file (`/tmp/benchkit.sh`).
            Defaults to True.
        timeout (Optional[int], optional):
            if not None, the command will be stopped after `timeout` seconds if it did not stop
            earlier.
            Defaults to None.
        output_is_log (bool, optional):
            whether the output of this command is logging and should be outputted as such, line by
            line (e.g. cmake or make command).
            Defaults to False.
        ignore_ret_codes (Iterable[int], optional):
            collection of error return codes to ignore if they are triggered.
            This allows to avoid an exception to be raised for commands that do not end with 0 even
            if they are successful.
            Defaults to ().
        split_arguments (bool, optional):
            whether the command is split in parts.
            This allows for the usage of commands using things like the pipe symbol,
            use with shell=True for this functionality.
            Defaults to True.

    Raises:
        subprocess.CalledProcessError:
            if the command exited with a non-zero exit code that is not ignored in
            `ignore_ret_codes`.
