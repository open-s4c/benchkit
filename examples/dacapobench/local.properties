# The build will attempt to construct each benchmark, and include each
# on that succeeded in the final jar.  If the construction of a
# benchmark does not succeed then it will ignore this and continue on
# to the next one.  To force the build to fail as soon as a benchmark
# fails set the build.failonerror to true in your local.properties
# file.

# DaCapo must be built with JDK 1.8 but jme, kafka, pmd, tomcat, 
# tradebeans, and trade soap require more recent JDKs.  The build process
# thus requires access to a JDK 11.
